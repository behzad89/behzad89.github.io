## a bit about me:
I am a spatial professional with extensive experience in data science and data engineering. Currently, I am a Ph.D. research assistance at the Swiss TPH institute. My interests include Geographic Information Science (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and environmental modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying geospatial big data, GeoAI (machine learning and deep learning), and cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Azure, etc.) to study climate change's environmental effects.

I always like to keep connected with the industry, therefore in the past three years I am working as a data Eng. in CollectiveCrunch oy. I process a wide range of sources including weather information for many years back; soil classifications; optical and other images taken from satellites, LIDAR information, and much more. The data is crunched into AI models to provide accurate predictions of forest inventories, forest damages, and carbon storage.

Open-source technologies are my preference, and mainly work with the Python and R programming languages; GIS and data analysis libraries such as GDAL/OGR, numpy, PyProj, sp, shapely, geopandas, pandas, matplotlib etc; and software such as QGIS and GRASS GIS, although I also have experience working with commercial software such as ESRI ArcGIS and its arcpy modules.

In addition to GIS, I also have skills in data science. I can carry out data acquisition, processing and analysisusing standalone Python and R scripts. Implemented different machine learning algorithms (LogisticRegression, SVM, RandomForest,GradientBoosting) to predict enviromnetal features. Expert in conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis, producing summary table.

Moreover, I also have skills for working with
* PostGIS software program that adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL object-relational database.
* REST APIs
* Software development tooling, such as version control
* AWS, Azure, Docker, and Linux OS

## Python Packages

- Developed Python CLI package (**senhub_batchapi**) to query on terminal and create request in Sentinel-HUB Batch API to create non-cloudy tiles to make mosaic.

- Developing Geo-Data Engineer Python package (**geoutils**) with five modules including: Grid, Cube, ModisAPI, DataExtraction, DataClean. The toolkit may be used to put together the huge Geospatial data for modeling purposes.
