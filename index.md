## a bit about me:
I am spatial professional with extensive experience in data science and data engineering. Currently, I am doing PhD at Swiss TPH institute. My research interests include Geographic Information Science (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and environmental modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying geospatial big data, GeoAI (machine learning and Deep learning) , and cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Azure etc.) to study Health & Environmental effects of air pollution & climage changes.

I always like to keep connection with industory, therefore in the past three years I am working as Geo-data Eng. in CollectiveCrunch oy. I process the wide range of sources including weather information for many years back; soil classifications; optical and other images taken from satellites, LIDAR information and much, much more. The data is crunched into AI models to provide with accurate predictions of forest inventories, forest damages and carbon storage.

Open-source technologies are my preference, and mainly work with the Python and R programming languages; GIS and data analysis libraries such as GDAL/OGR, numpy, PyProj, sp, shapely, geopandas, pandas, matplotlib etc; and software such as QGIS and GRASS GIS, although I also have experience working with commercial software such as ESRI ArcGIS and its arcpy modules.

In addition to GIS, I also have skills in data science. I can carry out data acquisition, processing and analysisusing standalone Python and R scripts. Implemented different machine learning algorithms (LogisticRegression, SVM, RandomForest,GradientBoosting) to predict enviromnetal features. Expert in conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis, producing summary table.
